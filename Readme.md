# How to Access the Application Model in Code


<p>This example demonstrates how to use the View.Model property to set the required value for the current ListView node's MasterDetailMode property. For this purpose, a new View Controller is created, and a SimpleAction is added to it. This Action allows end-users to switch between two modes: the current List View only and the current List View together with the corresponding Detail View.</p>
<p>See code in the SwitchController.cs (SwitchController.vb) file. For details, refer to the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#Xaf/CustomDocument2810">Access the Application Model in Code</a> topic in XAF documentation.</p>
